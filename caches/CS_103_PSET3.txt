Theorem: Prove that fis a bijection.
Proof: To prove that fis a bijection, we need to prove that fis injective and surjective.
Proof of injectivity: Pick an arbitrary a∈Nandb∈N, such that a=b. We need to show
thatf(a) =f(b). We can split the proof into two cases:
Case 1: aandbare even. Then, ∃k1, k2∈Nsuch that a= 2k1andb= 2k2. Since a=b, we
see
a=b
(2k1) = (2 k2)
k1=k2(1)
and thus, f(a) =k1=f(b) =k2.
Case 2: aandbare odd. Then, ∃k1, k2∈Nsuch that a= 2k1+ 1andb= 2k2+ 1. Since a=b,
we see
a=b
(2k1+ 1) = (2 k2+ 1)
2k1= 2k2
k1=k2(2)
and thus f(a) =−(k1+ 1) = f(b) =−(k2+ 1).
which is what we wanted to show.
Proof of Surjectivity: Pick an arbitrary y∈Z. We need to show there exists an x∈Nsuch
thatf(x) =y. We can split the proof into two cases:
Case 1: y=kfor some k∈N. Then, x= 2kis a solution.
Case 2: y=−(k+ 1)for some k∈N. Then, x= 2k+ 1is a solution.
Therefore, fis surjective. Since fis both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.

Problem Three: Strictly Increasing Functions
i.
f(x) =x2is not strictly increasing, but f(x) =x3is strictly increasing.
ii.
Theorem: Letf:Z→Zandg:Z→Zbe arbitrary strictly increasing functions. Prove that g◦fis
strictly increasing.
Proof: Consider any x, y∈Zsuch that x < y. We need to show that g(f(x))< g (f(y)). Be-
cause function fis strictly increasing and x < y, we know that f(x)< f(y). Furthermore, because function
gis strictly increasing and f(x)< f(y), we know that g(f(x))< g(f(y)), which is what we need to show.
iii.
Theorem: Letf:Z→Zbe an arbitrary strictly increasing function. Prove that fis injective.
Proof: We will prove the contrapositive, that if x̸=y,f(x)̸=f(y). To do so, consider any
x, y∈Zsuch that x̸=y. We want to show that f(x)̸=f(y). As x̸=y, either x < yory < x. Assume,
without loss of generality, that x < y. Because x < yandfis strictly increasing, we know that f(x)< f(y).
Because f(x)< f(y),f(x)̸=f(y), which is what we needed to show.
iv.
Theorem: Letf:Z→Zbe a strictly increasing function and consider any integers xandy. Prove that
iff(x) =y, and f(y) =x, then x=y.
Proof: We will take the contrapositive of the above theorem, namely if x̸=y, then f(x)̸=yor
f(y)̸=x. For the sake of contradiction, consider any x, y∈Zsuch that x̸=yandf(x) =yandf(y) =x.
Asx̸=y, either x < yory < x. Assume, without loss of generality, that x < y. Because x < y
andfis strictly increasing, we know that f(x)< f(y). We then see
f(x)< f(y)
y < x(3)
This is impossible because x < y. We have reached a contradiction, so our assumption must have been
wrong, so if x̸=y, then f(x)̸=yorf(y)̸=x, which is what we wanted to show.

Problem Four: Eventual Bijections
i. Fill in the blanks for Problem Four, part i. below.
•f3(2) = 9.
•f137(1) = 1.
•f0(137) = 137 .
ii.
Theorem: Letf:A→Abe a function. Prove that if f3is surjective, then fis surjective.
Proof: Pick an arbitrary y∈A. We need to show that there exists an x∈A, such that f(x) =y. Because
f3(x)is surjective, we know that there exists an a∈A, such that f(f(f(a))) = y. Now, let x=f(f(a)).
We see that
f(f(f(a))) = y
f(x) =y(4)
which is what we wanted to prove.
iii.
Theorem: Letf:A→Abe a function. Prove that if f3is injective, then fis injective.
Proof: We will prove the the contrapositive: if fis not injective, f3is not injective. Pick an
a, b∈A, such that a̸=b. We want to show that f3(a)̸=f3(b). Because fis injecitve and a̸=b, we know
thatf(a)̸=f(b). We then see
f(a)̸=f(b)
f(f(a))̸=f(f(b))
f(f(f(a)))̸=f(f(f(b)))(5)
which is what we needed to show.

Problem Five: Understanding Diagonalization
i.
N
ii.
Any element that is not the empty set and that does not contain all the elements in the domain (i.e. {5})
iii.
This set contains all natural numbers that are < n.
iv.
All natural numbers that are < n−1
v.
f(n) ={n∈N|2n−1}. This function produces all natural numbers that are odd. Therefore, the set D will
contain any natural number that is no odd, and not contain any number that is odd (even natural numbers).

Problem Six: Simplifying Cantor’s Theorem?
The incorrect statement is the following: "Since fis not surjective, it is not a bijection. Thus |S| ̸=|℘(S)|."
fnot being surjective does not prove that |S| ̸=|℘(S)|because there could be some other function that is
bijective. In order to prove that |S| ̸=|℘(S)|, we must pick an arbitrary function f:S→℘(S)and prove
that it is not bijective.

Problem Seven: Proofs on Sets
iii.
Theorem: For all sets AandB, if℘(A) =℘(B), then A=B.
Proof: For the sake of contradiction, assume that ℘(A) = ℘(B)andA̸=B. Therefore, there
exists an x∈A, where x /∈B. Ifx∈A,{x} ∈℘(A). Because ℘(A) =℘(B),{x} ∈℘(B). However, this is
impossible because x /∈B. We have reached a contradiction, so our previous assumption must be false.

Problem Eight: The Universal Set
i.
Theorem: Prove that if AandBare arbitrary subsets where A⊆B, then |A| ≤ |B|.
Proof: Pick two arbitrary subsets AandBwhere A⊆B. Secondly, consider the function f:A→B
where f(x) =x. We want to show that fis an injection.
First, we’ll show that fis a well-defined function. Because A⊆B, we know that ∀x(x∈A→x∈B).
Therefore, for any x∈A, we have f(x) =x∈B
Second, we’ll show that fis injective. Pick any x1, x2,∈Awhere f(x1) = f(x2). We need to show
thatx1=x2. Since f(x1) =f(x2), we see by definition of fthatx1=x2, as required.
Because fis an injection, it follows that |A| ≤ |B|.
ii.
Theorem: LetUbe the universal set discussed in problem 8’s description. Using your result from (i),
prove that if U exists, then |℘(U)| ≤ |U|.
Proof: Consider the function f:℘(U)→Uwhere f(x) = x. Because we proved earlier that if
A⊆B, then |A| ≤ |B|, we want to prove that ℘(U)⊆U.
Assuming that Uexists, we know that ∀x(x∈U). It follows that for any x∈℘(U),x∈U.
Therefore, ℘(U)⊆U. Because ℘(U)⊆U, we know from the earlier proof that |℘(U)| ≤ |U|.
iii.
Write your answer to Problem Eight, part iii. here.
iv.
Theorem: LetUbe the universal set discussed in problem 8’s description. Prove that Udoes not exist.
Proof: Above, we proved that if Uexists, then |℘(U)| ≤ | U|. By contrapositive, if |℘(U)|>|U|,
then Udoes not exist. Thus, we need to show that |℘(U)|>|U|.
By Cantor’s Theorem, we know that because Uis a set, |U|<|℘(U)|, which is what we needed to
show.
