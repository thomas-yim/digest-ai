        "This reference text explores the various ways in which language reclamation and revitalization are being used to combat language death. It examines the roles of language activists, linguists, and educators in the process, as well as the ideologies of endangerment, the effects of media framing, and the importance of language to ethnolinguistic identity. It looks at the strategies deployed to raise public awareness and the impact of these rhetorics on language reclamation efforts, such as universal ownership, hyperbolic valorisation, and enumeration, as well as three additional related strategies of linguistic extraction, erasure of colonial agency, and \u2018lasting\u2019. It also looks at the importance of collaboration and the challenges of language reclamation, emphasizing the need to contextualize endangered languages and focus on language survivance rather than lasting."
